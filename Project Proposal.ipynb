    "Our topic for this final Data Science Sequence Project is **food security**, i.e. consistent accessibility to sufficient food, in the United States. <br> <br>\n",
    "The prevailing definition of food security, agreed upon at the 1996 World Food Summit, is “access by all members at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life”. This implies the ready availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, and an assured ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways. The United States Census Bureau last conducted a survey regarding food security in December 2021, and we are looking to use the responses from this survey to categorize whether or not a household has high food security or low food security. Based on the census data, we will train models to predict these responses, and can also make comparisons between the predictive accuracy of a model that predicts general food security and possibly model(s) that predict food security for children in households, or food security amongst adults in households, as these response variables are present in the extensive census dataset as well."

The data contains the responses of the annual **CPS (Current Population Survey) Food Security Supplement**, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This survey is conducted across the United States, in order to research the range of food security experienced in U.S. households.

Generally, the variables S8B through S8D deal with minimum food spending needed, whereas predictors S9 through SP9 deal with food program participation. Other predictors deal with food sufficiency and ways of coping with not having enough food.

Currently, [they] obtain interviews from about 54,000 households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of residence to represent the nation as a whole, individual states, and other specified areas. Each household is interviewed once a month for four consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a year later. This technique enables [them] to obtain reliable month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience to any one household.” \n"
